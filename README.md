📝 Project Overview

🎯 Objective:
To analyze Airbnb listings in Seattle with a focus on pricing, revenue, and property characteristics across zip codes and bedrooms.

🔧 Project Workflow:

1️⃣ Data Preparation

Cleaned and formatted the Airbnb datasets for consistency.

Structured the data (dates, prices, zip codes, bedrooms) for effective visualization.

2️⃣ Data Visualization (Tableau)

Created multiple visualizations to uncover trends and insights:

Price per Zip Code: Analyzed average property prices by zip code.

Price per Zip Code (Map View): Visualized pricing geographically across Seattle using map-based analytics.

Revenue per Year: Tracked annual revenue trends from Airbnb listings.

Average Price per Bedroom: Identified how bedroom count affects pricing.

Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings: Analyzed the availability of listings by bedroom count.

These visualizations are consolidated into an interactive dashboard for easy exploration and business insights.

🚀 Key Insights from the Dashboard:

Certain zip codes consistently command higher prices, highlighting premium neighborhoods.

Geographical visualization clearly shows price clusters across Seattle.

Revenue trends by year help understand seasonal and annual performance.

Pricing correlates with bedroom count; more bedrooms typically lead to higher prices.

Identified listing distribution by bedroom count, helping understand market saturation and opportunities.
